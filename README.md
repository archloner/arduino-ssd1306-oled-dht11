# Arduino SSD1306 OLED Display + DHT11
Arduino project using Arduino UNO with SSD1306 OLED display and DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor.

## Description
Arduino reads sensor data from DHT11 sensor connected on pin 2, and stores them in variables along with maximal values recorder during operation period of device. Temperature and humidity readings from sensor are then displayed on a OLED display in form of three screens, changing constantly after set period of time.
